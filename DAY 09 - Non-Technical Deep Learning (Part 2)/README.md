# 🧠 Day 9: Non-Technical Deep Learning (Part 2)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand how deep learning extracts features from data.
- Recognize the importance of big data in training deep models.
- Appreciate the layered learning process.

## 📚 Summary
Deep learning works by breaking down data in stages. Each layer extracts features, from simple to complex, requiring large datasets to perform effectively.

## 🔍 Key Insights
- **Shallow layers** detect basic features (edges, colors).
- **Deeper layers** combine features to detect objects or meaning.
- **Large datasets** help prevent overfitting and boost accuracy.

## 🧩 Analogy
> Think of deep learning as peeling an onion—each layer reveals more detail about the data.

## 🎨 Visual Suggestion
Show a progression from a raw image → edge detection → object detection → label prediction.
