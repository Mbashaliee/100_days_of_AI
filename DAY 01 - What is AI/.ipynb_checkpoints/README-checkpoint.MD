# 🧠 Day 1: What is AI?

## 🗒️ Overview

**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** refers to computer systems designed to perform tasks that normally require human intelligence. Modern AI systems can:

- 🧠 Simulate human **learning**, **comprehension**, **decision-making**, and **pattern recognition**  
- 🔍 Power **search engines**, **chatbots**, **spam filters**, and **recommendation engines**

🔸 **Narrow AI**: Specialized for a specific task (e.g. Siri, Google Search, ChatGPT)  
🔸 **General AI (AGI)**: Human-level intelligence – *still theoretical*  
🔸 **Superintelligence**: Surpasses human capabilities – *a sci-fi concept*

AI has evolved through several milestones:

- **1950**: Alan Turing proposes the *Turing Test*
- **1956**: "AI" coined at the Dartmouth Conference
- **1997**: IBM’s Deep Blue defeats chess champion Garry Kasparov
- **2010s**: Rise of virtual assistants (Siri, Cortana)
- **2020s**: Generative AI boom (e.g., ChatGPT, DALL·E)

AI is now embedded in our everyday lives—driving cars, recognizing images, translating languages, and more.

## 🔍 Detailed Explanation & Insights

### 📌 AI Definition and Scope

AI is a broad field focused on creating systems that:

- Learn from data
- Make intelligent decisions
- Understand language, images, and audio

It combines **computer science**, **statistics**, and **mathematics**—often implemented via **machine learning (ML)** and **deep learning (DL)**.

### 🔄 Narrow AI vs General AI

| Feature                | Narrow AI                          | General AI                      |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Scope                  | Single task                        | Human-like multi-tasking         |
| Example                | Image classifiers, chatbots        | Still hypothetical               |
| Capability             | Data-specific, rule-based          | Adaptive, flexible               |

⚠️ Today, all real-world AI is **Narrow AI**. AGI and Superintelligence are yet to be realized.
