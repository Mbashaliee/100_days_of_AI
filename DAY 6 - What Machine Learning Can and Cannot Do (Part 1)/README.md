# 🧠 Day 6: What Machine Learning Can and Cannot Do (Part 1)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand common ML tasks like classification and prediction.
- Recognize what ML systems are good at.
- Identify the boundaries of current ML capabilities.

## 📚 Summary
Machine Learning (ML) is powerful, but it’s not magic. It excels at pattern recognition tasks, especially when there's lots of data. However, it struggles with general reasoning, causality, and context-based understanding.

## ✅ What ML Can Do
- **Classification** (e.g., spam vs. not spam)
- **Prediction** (e.g., price forecasting)
- **Recommendation** (e.g., movies, books)
- **Clustering** (e.g., customer segmentation)

## ❌ What ML Cannot Do (Yet)
- Understand intent and emotions deeply
- Generalize beyond training data
- Make ethical decisions
- Explain decisions in human terms (black-box issue)

## 🧩 Real-World Examples
| Use Case | ML Strength | Limitations |
|----------|-------------|-------------|
| Email Spam Detection | Classification | Context misinterpretation |
| Loan Prediction | Pattern Recognition | Can't account for bias |

## 🧠 Reflection
> Think of an area where ML has succeeded and one where it has failed. Why?
