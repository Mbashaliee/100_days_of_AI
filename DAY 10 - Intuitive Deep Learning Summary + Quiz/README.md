# 🧠 Day 10 Intuitive Deep Learning Summary + Quiz

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Recap key deep learning ideas.
- Review intuitive explanations.
- Test understanding through questions.

## 📚 Summary
This final day in the deep learning section summarizes all the non-technical concepts using visuals, analogies, and a short quiz. It reinforces how deep learning models process data and make predictions.

## 🧠 Recap Checklist
- Neural networks simulate human brain logic using layers.
- Each layer transforms the input into higher-level features.
- Learning happens by adjusting weights to reduce errors.

## 🧩 Analogy
 Training a deep learning model is like a child learning to recognize faces—it improves with more examples and feedback.

## 🎨 Visual Suggestion
Flowchart summarizing  
`Input → Layers → Feature Extraction → Output Prediction → Feedback (error) → Learning`

## 📝 Quiz (Sample)
1. What do weights in a neural network represent  
2. Why do deeper networks require more data  
3. What is the role of hidden layers in a network  
4. True or False Deep learning models understand language like humans.  
5. What’s a real-world task where DL outperforms traditional ML
