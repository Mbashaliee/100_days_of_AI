# 🧠 Day 7: More Examples of ML Strengths and Weaknesses (Part 2)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Explore more real-life use cases of ML.
- Understand unrealistic vs realistic expectations.
- Learn to critically evaluate ML use in society.

## 📚 Summary
While ML is transforming many industries, its effectiveness depends on context, data, and expectations. We examine examples from critical domains.

## 📊 Use Case Deep Dive

### 1. Medicine
- ✅ Strength: Image-based diagnostics (e.g., X-ray classification)
- ❌ Limitation: Diagnosing rare diseases without enough data

### 2. Law
- ✅ Strength: Legal document classification
- ❌ Limitation: Bias in sentencing algorithms

### 3. Agriculture
- ✅ Strength: Predicting crop yields
- ❌ Limitation: Struggles with unpredictable weather patterns

## ⚖️ Unrealistic Expectations
- “ML will replace doctors.” → No, it assists but doesn’t replace.
- “ML is always objective.” → No, it learns from human biases.
