# 🧠 Day 8: Non-Technical Deep Learning (Part 1)

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand neural networks at a conceptual level.
- Explore analogies for how deep learning works.
- Grasp the idea of weights, layers, and learning.

## 📚 Summary
Deep learning is a subset of ML that uses artificial neural networks to learn from data. These models simulate how the human brain processes information.

## 🧠 Conceptual Understanding
- A **neural network** is like a layered stack of filters that learn patterns.
- Each layer detects increasingly complex patterns.
- **Weights** are like knobs that adjust the importance of each feature.

## 🧩 Analogy
> A neural network is like a brain with interconnected "neurons" that fire based on input signals and learned importance.
